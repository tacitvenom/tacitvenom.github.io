title: Do we not like like watching women on screen?
---

I like to watch movies when I need to unwind and have phases where I obsessively watch recommendations. One of the movies that was on my wishlist for a long time was "Oppenheimer". Finally when I watched it, I was impressed by the direction and performances, despite having high expectations to start with. What, however, was extremely off-putting was watching just men talking to other men, making decisions that impact all of us and barely any women outside of men's love interests. This lack of representation is not unique to Oppenheimer, but it is a common issue in the film industry.

To be fair, Oppenheimer is based on 1930-1940s era where women were not given equal opportunities at important positions and for a movie that depicts the times, it can be argued that the lack of representation is a reflection of the era.

Interestingly though, the lack of depth of female characters depicted in movies was and is so absymal that in 1985, an iconic [comic strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dykes_to_Watch_Out_For_(Bechdel_test_origin).jpg) came up with an ingenious yet simple test, which is now commonly known as Bechdel Test. There are many variations of the test, but the original test is as follows:

1. The movie must have at least two women in it.
2. The women must talk to each other.
3. Their conversation must be about something other than a man.

Take a moment to reflect how easy or difficult it should be to pass the test, given that the around 50% of the world's population is not male. Each human's life has as many difficult moments, complex decisions, drama and pain as any other.

If you identify as a woman, try to remember the last time you talked to another woman about something other than a man. I hope that is not too rare to remember or too back in the past to recall. If you don't, then try to recall the last time you heard them talking about something other than a man. Again, shopping counts, make-up counts, work counts.

Passing this test is by no means equate with being an epitome of feminism, just a reminder of how poorly represented women are.
