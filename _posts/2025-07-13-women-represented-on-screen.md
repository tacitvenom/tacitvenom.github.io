title: Do we not like like watching women on screen?
---

I like to watch movies when I need to unwind and have phases where I obsessively watch recommendations. One of the movies that was on my wishlist for a long time was "Oppenheimer". Finally when I watched it, I was impressed by the direction and performances, despite having high expectations to start with. What, however, was extremely off-putting was watching just men talking to other men, making decisions that impact all of us and barely any women outside of men's love interests. This lack of representation is not unique to Oppenheimer, but it is a common issue in the film industry.

To be fair, Oppenheimer is based on 1930-1940s era where women were not given equal opportunities at important positions and for a movie that depicts the times, it can be argued that the lack of representation is a reflection of the era.

Interestingly though, the lack of depth of female characters depicted in movies was and is so absymal that in 1985, an iconic [comic strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dykes_to_Watch_Out_For_(Bechdel_test_origin).jpg) came up with an ingenious yet simple test, which is now commonly known as Bechdel Test. There are many variations of the test, but the original test is as follows:

1. The movie must have at least two women in it.
2. The women must talk to each other.
3. Their conversation must be about something other than a man.

Take a moment to reflect how easy or difficult it should be to pass the test, given that the around 50% of the world's population is not male. Each human's life has as many difficult moments, complex decisions, drama and pain as any other.

If you identify as a woman, try to remember the last time you talked to another woman about something other than a man. I hope that is not too rare to remember or too back in the past to recall. If you don't, then try to recall the last time you heard them talking about something other than a man. Again, shopping counts, make-up counts, work counts (if we want to bring in more stereotypes, be my guest).

As an analogy, I assume that passing the test would be as easy as passing the criterion that the movie has a scene with a tree. Women are everywhere, trees are everywhere. Okay, fine, if the movie is about a man in the wilderness fighting a bear (The Revenant) then I can understand why the movie does not have a two women talking to each other about something other than a man. But this would be rather the exception than the norm.

Just for clarification, by no means is passing this test would imply that movie is now the epitome of feminism either or a sign of healthy representation of women. It could just be an easy demonstration of the lack of depth of female characters depicted in that movie, if we see systematically that movies fail the test.

## Top 25 IMDb movies on Bechdel Test
For starters, I looked at the IMDb Top movies (top 25 movies at first) and then researched if they passed the Bechdel Test. That lead me to a beautiful corner of the internet - https://bechdeltest.com/. This is where wonderful people crowd-vote for movies and the test. They have a slightly different version of the test in which they expect the two female characters to be named.
Let's start with a simple visualization showing how many of the top 25 IMDb movies (as of July 2025) pass the Bechdel Test:

Now that is much worse than I expected. 50% of the world population either does not get named characters in the movie or don't have an independent conversation with each other or if they do, it is about a man after all. This is a clear indication that the female characters are not well developed and are often used as plot devices rather than as complex characters.

But wait, let's not jump the gun here. Maybe everyone just talks about the opposite sex. Maybe the movies are failing the test because both sexes just talk about the other sex. Maybe, just maybe, if only so many movies would also fail the Reverse Bechdel Test, we shouldn't be so shocked after all. (Well, in that case, I would argue that the movies are possibly laser-focussed on the romantic aspect of straight people, which is still a fair critique but not the topic of discussion.)

## Comparison with the Reverse Bechdel Test

Just out of fairness, let's also look at how these same movies perform on the Reverse Bechdel Test:
