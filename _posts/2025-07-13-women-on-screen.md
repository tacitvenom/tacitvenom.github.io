title: Women on screen?
---

I like to watch movies when I need to unwind and have phases where I obsessively watch recommendations. One of the movies that was on my wishlist for a long time was "Oppenheimer". Finally when I watched it, I was impressed by the direction and performances, despite having high expectations to start with. What, however, was extremely off-putting, was watching just men talking to other men, making decisions that impact all of us and barely any women apart from men's love interests. This lack of representation is not unique to Oppenheimer, but it is a common issue in the film industry.

To be fair, Oppenheimer is based on the 1930-1940s era, where women were not given equal opportunities at important positions and for a movie that depicts the times, it can be argued that the lack of representation is a reflection of the era.

## The Bechdel Test

Interestingly though, the lack of depth of female characters depicted in movies was and is so absymal, that in 1985, an iconic [comic strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dykes_to_Watch_Out_For_(Bechdel_test_origin).jpg) came up with an ingenious yet simple test, which is now commonly known as Bechdel Test. There are many variations of the test, but the original test is as follows:

1. The movie must have **at least two women** in it.
2. The women must talk **to each other**.
3. Their conversation must be **about something other than a man**.

**Disclaimer**: I realise that the description is not fair to non-gendered individuals and this is definitely a shortcoming and a fair critique, which I would like to incorporate but lack the time and openly available data to leverage. For this post, I will focus on the Bechdel test, which seems to be primarily focused on the man-woman dichotomy.

Take a moment to reflect how easy or difficult it should be to pass the test, given that around 50% of the world's population is not male. Each human's life has as many difficult moments, complex decisions, drama and pain as any other.

If you identify as a woman, try to remember the last time you talked to another woman about something other than a man. I hope that is not too rare to remember or too back in the past to recall. If you don't identify as a woman, then try to recall the last time you overheard them talking about something other than a man. Again, shopping counts, make-up counts, work counts (if we want to bring in more stereotypes, be my guest).

As an analogy, I assume that passing the test would be as easy as passing the criterion that the movie has a scene with a tree. Women are everywhere, trees are everywhere. Okay, fine, if the movie is about a man in the wilderness fighting a bear ("The Revenant"), then I can understand why the movie does not have two women talking to each other about something other than a man. But this would be rather the exception than the norm.

Just for clarification, by no means passing this test should or would imply that the movie is now an epitome of feminism or a sign of healthy representation of women.
While the test is not perfect, it is a good starting point for understanding the representation of women on screen.

## Top 25 IMDb movies on Bechdel Test

For starters, I looked at the IMDb Top movies (top 25 movies at first, for simplicity) and then researched if they passed the Bechdel Test. This should be a good representation of the movies that are most popular. Even though I have watched them all, I couldn't remember all the scenes and provide a judgement as to the test. That lead me to a beautiful corner of the internet - [bechdeltest.com](https://bechdeltest.com/). This is where wonderful people crowd-vote if and how a movie passes or fails the test. They have a slightly different version of the test in which they expect the two female characters to be named.
Let's start with a simple visualization showing how many of the top 25 IMDb movies (as of July 2025) pass the Bechdel Test:

Now that is much worse than I expected. 50% of the world population either does not get named characters in the movies or don't have an independent conversation with each other, or if they do, it is about a man after all. This is a clear indication that the female characters are not well developed and are often used as plot devices rather than as complex characters.
There were some dubious passes which I have marked as controversial.
For example, here are a few comments for the movie "It's a Wonderful Life" that concludes that it passes (although dubiously):

> Pretty certain Mom and little Suzu's teacher (mom calls her 'Mrs [something]') are on the phone talking about Suzu's cold and her flower, when dad grabs the phone from mom and mr teacher then grabs the phone from mrs teacher.

Or another one:

> Additionally, in the final scene Mrs Bailey comments the fact that the maid Annie is contributing to the money collection, to which Anne replies that it's the money she had been saving for the divorce in case she ever got a husband. It's not talking about a man but about women's saving strategies!

It was both sad and entertaining to read comments on whether a movie technically passes or not. I happily grab some popcorn reading internet fights, but it's also important to remember the point that Alison Bechdel (the cartoonist behind the comic strip and the test) wanted to highlight, and let's not get carried away by the technicalities.

The test was first mentioned in 1985 but still wasn't as well known. Looking at the Google Trends data, we can see that the test has gained popularity over the last years, but in my opinion, it is still not as widely known as it should be. I learned about it only recently.
Some of the recent movies had exactly one or two short scene(s) that made it pass the test, but imagine a movie that runs for two hours and has 1 scene lasting 2 minutes that makes the cut. Some comments also mention that it feels like now that the test is becoming more popular, the directors make it a point to technically pass the test. Looking at the Google Trends data for Bechdel Test, we can see that the popularity of the test has been increasing over the years.

The distribution of movies passing the Bechdel Test over time captured below by decade shows a steady increase in the number of movies that meet the criteria. Whether it's due to increased awareness or a genuine effort to improve representation, the trend is encouraging.

## Comparison with the "Reverse Bechdel" Test

But wait, let's not jump the gun here. Unless we look at the number of criteria that are not met, we can't really conclude that the problem lies in representation of women on screen. A possible explanation could be that perhaps everyone just talks about the opposite sex, i.e., mostly the last criterion is not being met.
If that's our premise, then we should also look at the "Reverse Bechdel" Test (of course, not an official term), which I describe as:

1. The movie must have **at least two men** in it.
2. The men must talk **to each other**.
3. Their conversation must be **about something other than a woman**.

If a lot of movies don't pass the "Reverse Bechdel" Test, it might suggest that the issue isn't just about representation but probably the obsession of film industry with romantic aspects.

On a closer inspection of the same set of movies and assessment on the "Reverse Bechdel" Test, the results are as expected - 100% of the movies. Each one of them. Men cry, men drink, men fight, worry about money or drugs or hope.
But women are only someone associated with a man - a love interest, wife, daughter, mother, sister, friend.
While I think it's important to acknowledge the progress made in terms of representation, we must also recognize that there is still a long way to go. The lack of diversity in storytelling and the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes are significant issues that need to be addressed.

I surely had fun analysing this small sample of movies and would love to extend this analysis to a larger dataset.
